# 1 ROS project structure

## 1.1 catkin workspace

Catkin workspace is the directory where catkin software packages are created, modified, and compiled. Catkin's workspace can be intuitively described as a warehouse, which contains various ROS project projects to facilitate system organization, management and calling.

- **Create workspace**:
  
```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src  # Create a folder
cd ~/catkin_ws/src        # Enter the folder
catkin_init_workspace     # Initialize the current directory into a ROS workspace
cd ..                     # Return to the parent directory
catkin_make               # Build the code in the workspace
```

The structure of catkin is very clear. It includes three paths: src, build, and devel. It may also include others under some compilation options. But these three folders are the default for the catkin compilation system. Their specific functions are as follows:

```bash
src/: ROS catkin software package (source code package)
 
build/: cache information and intermediate files of catkin (CMake)
 
devel/: Generated target files (including header files, dynamic link libraries, static link libraries, executable files, etc.), environment variables
```

A simple workspace looks like this:

```bash
workspace_folder/        -- WORKSPACE
  src/                   -- SOURCE SPACE
    CMakeLists.txt       -- 'Toplevel' CMake file, provided by catkin
    package_1/
      CMakeLists.txt     -- CMakeLists.txt file for package_1
      package.xml        -- Package manifest for package_1
    ...
    package_n/
      CMakeLists.txt     -- CMakeLists.txt file for package_n
      package.xml        -- Package manifest for package_n
```

## 1.2 ROS software package

Package is not only a software package on Linux, but also the basic unit of catkin compilation. The object we use catkin_make to compile is each ROS package.

```bash
+--PACKAGE
     +-- CMakeLists.txt 
     +-- package.xml 
     +-- src/ 
     +-- include/ 
     +-- scripts/
     +-- msg/ 
     +-- srv/ 
     +-- urdf/
     +-- launch/
```

- **CMakeLists.txt:** Defines the package name, dependencies, source files, target files and other compilation rules of the package. It is an essential component of the package.

- **package.xml:** Describes the package name, version number, author, dependencies and other information of the package, which is an indispensable component of the package.

- **src/:** stores ROS source code, including C++ source code (.cpp) and Python module (.py)

- **include/:** stores the header files corresponding to the C++ source code

- **scripts/:** stores executable scripts, such as shell scripts (.sh), Python scripts (.py)

- **msg/:** stores messages in custom format (.msg)

- **srv/:** stores services in custom formats (.srv)

- **urdf/:** stores the robot’s model description (.urdf or .xacro) and 3D model files (.sda, .stl, .dae, etc.)

- **launch/:** stores launch files (.launch or .xml)

**Create your own package:**

- Command format:
  
The catkin_create_pkg command will ask you to enter package_name. If necessary, you can also add some other dependent software packages later:

```bash
catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
```

- For example:
  
```bash
catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
```

## 2.3 Introduction to msg and srv

* msg：The msg file is a simple text file describing the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages (c++ or python, etc.).
* srv：srv files are used to describe services. It consists of two parts: the request (request) and the response (response).
msg files are stored in the msg directory of the package, and srv files are stored in the srv directory.

# 3 Introduction to URDF

* Unified Robot Description Format，Unified Robot Description Format, abbreviated as URDF. The urdf package in ROS contains a C++ parser for URDF, and URDF files describe robot models in XML format.
*URDF cannot be used alone, it needs to be combined with Rviz or Gazebo. URDF is just a file that needs to be rendered into a graphical robot model in Rviz or Gazebo.

## 3.1 urdf file description

**Code example:**

Only part of the code is intercepted here for display:

```bash
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot  xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro" name="mycobot_ai_with" >

  <xacro:property name="width" value=".2" />

  <link name="env">
  <inertial>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <mass value="10"/>
      <inertia
        ixx="1.0" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0"
        iyy="1.0" iyz="0.0"

       <mesh filename="package://mycobot_description/urdf/mycobot/suit_env.dae"/>
      </geometry>
      <origin xyz = "0 0 0.0" rpy = "1.5708 0 -1.5708"/>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <link name="joint1">
    <inertial>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.1" rpy="0 0 0"/>
      <mass value="0.2"/>
      <inertia
        ixx="1.0" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0"
        iyy="1.0" iyz="0.0"
        izz="1.0"/>
  </inertial>
    <visual>
      <geometry>
	     <!--- 0.0 0 -0.04  1.5708 3.14159-->
       <mesh filename="package://mycobot_description/urdf/mycobot/joint1.dae"/>
      </geometry>
      <origin xyz = "0.0 0 0.02 " rpy = " 0 0 -1.5708"/>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
	     <!--- 0.0 0 -0.04  1.5708 3.14159-->
       <mesh filename="package://mycobot_description/urdf/mycobot/joint1.dae"/>
        </geometry>
        <origin xyz = "0.0 0 0.02 " rpy = " 0 0 -1.5708"/>
    </collision>
  </link>

  <joint name="vision_joint" type="fixed">
    <axis xyz="0 0 0"/>
    <limit effort = "1000.0" lower = "-3.14" upper = "3.14159" velocity = "0"/>
    <parent link="env"/>
    <child link="joint1"/>
    <origin xyz= "0 0 0" rpy = "0 0 0"/>
  </joint>

<link name="world"/>
<joint name="fixed" type="fixed">
  <parent link="world"/>
  <child link="env"/>
</joint>

</robot>


```


It can be seen that the urdf file is not complicated, it is mainly composed of two parts, `link` and `joint`, which are repeated continuously.

#### 3.3.1 properties of joint:
**name：**

Specifies a unique name for the joint

**type：**

Specifies the type of joint, where type can be one of the following:
+ revolute - A hinged joint that rotates along an axis, the range of which is specified by the upper and lower bounds.
+ Continuous - A continuous hinged joint that rotates around an axis with no upper and lower bounds.
+ Prismatic - A sliding joint that slides along an axis, the range of which is specified by upper and lower limits.
+Fixed - this is not really a joint because it cannot move. All degrees of freedom are locked. This type of joint does not require axes, calibration, dynamics, limits or safety_controller。
+ Floating - This joint allows motion in all 6 degrees of freedom.
+ Plane - This joint allows movement in a plane perpendicular to the axis.
  
#### 3.3.2 elements of joint

+ `<origin>` (optional，defaults to identity if not specified)
  In the transformation from parent link to child link, the joint is located at the origin of the child link. Modifying this parameter can adjust the position of the connecting rod. It can be used to adjust the error between the actual model and the theoretical model, but it is not recommended to modify it greatly, because this parameter affects the connecting rod stl The position of , easily affects the collision detection effect.

    + xyz (optional: default to zero vector)
      Represents the offset in the x , y , z x,y,zx,y,z axis directions, in meters.
    + rpy (optional: default to zero vector)
      Represents the angle of rotation around a fixed axis: roll is around the x-axis, pitch is around the y-axis, and yaw is around the z-axis, expressed in radians.
+ `<parent>` (required)

  + The name of the parent link is a mandatory attribute.
  + link
   The name of the parent link is the name of the link in the robot structure tree.

+ `<child>` (required)

  + The name of the child link is a mandatory attribute.
  + link
    The name of the child link is the name of the link in the robot structure tree.


+ `<axis>`(optional: defaults to (1,0,0))

  + The joint's axis is in the joint's coordinate system. This is the axis of rotation (revolute joint), the axis of movement of the prismatic joint, and the standard plane of the planar joint. This axis is specified in the joint coordinate system. Modifying this parameter can adjust the axis around which the joint rotates. It is often used to adjust the rotation direction. If the model rotation is opposite to the actual one, just multiply by -1. Fixed and floating joints do not need this element.
  + xyz(required)
    x , y , z x, y, zx, y, z components representing axis vectors, as normalized vectors.

+ `<calibration>` (optional)

  + The reference point of the joint, used to correct the absolute position of the joint.

    When the joint is moving forward, the reference point triggers a rising edge.
  + falling (optional)
    When the joint is moving forward, the reference point triggers a falling edge.

+ `<dynamics>`(optional)

  + This element is used to specify the physical properties of the joint. Its value is used to describe the modeling performance of the joint, especially during simulation.

`<limit>` (Required when the joint is a rotation or translation joint)

  + This element is a joint kinematics constraint.
  + lower (optional, default to 0)
    Specify the attribute of the lower bound of the joint's motion range (the unit of the revolute joint is radians, and the unit of the prismatic joint is meters). This attribute is ignored for continuous joints.
  + upper (optional, defaults to 0)

  + effort (required)
    This property specifies the maximum force at which the joint will run.
  + velocity (required)
 This property specifies the maximum speed of the joint runtime.

`<mimic>`(optional)

  + This tag is used to specify a defined joint to mimic an existing joint. The value of this joint can be calculated using the following formula:
    `value = multiplier * other_joint_value + offset`
  + joint(required)
      The name of the joint to mimic.
  + multiplier(optional)
    Specify the multiplier factor in the above formula.
  + offset(optional)
    Specify the offset term in the above formula. Default value is 0

`<safety_controller>` (optional)

  + This element is a security control limit. The data under this element will be read into move_group, but it is invalid in practice. Move_group will skip this limit and directly read the parameter content under limit. At the same time, setting this element may cause planning failure.
  + soft_lower_limit (optional, defaults to 0)
    This attribute specifies the lower bound of the joint security control boundary, which is the starting limit point of the joint security control. This value needs to be greater than the lower value in the above limit.
  + soft_upper_limit (optional, defaults to 0)
    This attribute specifies the upper bound of the joint security control boundary, which is the starting limit point of the joint security control. This value needs to be less than the upper value in the above limit.
  + k_position(optional, defaults to 0)
    This attribute is used to describe the relationship between position and velocity.
  + k_velocity(required)
    This property is used to describe the relationship between force and velocity.
