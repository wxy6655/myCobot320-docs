# 1 ROS2 project structure

## 1.1 colcon workspace

The colocn workspace is the directory where software packages are created, modified, and compiled. Colcon's workspace can be intuitively described as a warehouse, which contains various ROS project projects to facilitate system organization, management and calling.

- **Create workspace**:
  
```bash
mkdir -p ~/colcon_ws/src # Create folder
cd ~/colcon_ws/ # Enter the folder
colcon build # Build the code in the workspace.
```

**Note:** colcon supports option `--symlink-install`. This allows for faster iteration by changing installed files by changing files in the source space (such as Python files or other uncompiled resources). Avoid the need to recompile every time you modify your python script.

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

A ROS workspace is a directory with a particular structure. Commonly there is a `src` subdirectory. Inside that subdirectory is where the source code of ROS packages will be located. Typically the directory starts otherwise empty.

colcon does out of source builds. By default it will create the following directories as peers of the `src` directory:

```bash
src/: colcon package for ROS2 (source code package)
 
build/: The location where intermediate files are stored. For each package, a subfolder is created in which CMake is called, for example.
 
install/: The installation location of each package. By default, each package will be installed into a separate subdirectory.

log/: Contains various logging information about each colcon call.
```

The directory structure of a ROS2 workspace is as follows:

```bash
WorkSpace --- Customized workspace.
     |--- build: The directory where intermediate files are stored. A separate subdirectory will be created for each function package in this directory.
     |--- install: Installation directory, a separate subdirectory will be created for each function package in this directory.
     |--- log: Log directory, used to store log files.
     |--- src: Directory used to store function package source code.
         |-- C++ function package
             |-- package.xml: package information, such as: package name, version, author, dependencies.
             |-- CMakeLists.txt: Configure compilation rules, such as source files, dependencies, and target files.
             |-- src: C++ source file directory.
             |-- include: header file directory.
             |-- msg: message interface file directory.
             |-- srv: Service interface file directory.
             |-- action: action interface file directory.
         |-- Python function package
             |-- package.xml: package information, such as: package name, version, author, dependencies.
             |-- setup.py: similar to CMakeLists.txt of C++ function package.
             |-- setup.cfg: Function package basic configuration file.
             |-- resource: resource directory.
             |-- test: stores test-related files.
             |-- Directory with the same name of the function package: Python source file directory.
```

## 1.2 ROS2 package

Package is not only a software package on Linux, but also the basic unit of colcon compilation. The object we use `colcon build` to compile is each ROS2 package.

**Create your own package:**

- The command syntax for creating a software package using Python is:
  
```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python <package_name>
```

- For example:
  
```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --node-name my_node my_package
```

# 2 Basic tool commands

In this chapter, you will learn about the common command tools of ROS2.

## 2.1 Topics

ROS 2 breaks complex systems down into many modular nodes. Topics are a vital element of the ROS graph that act as a bus for nodes to exchange messages.
Topics are one of the main ways in which data is moved between nodes and therefore between different parts of the system.

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html)

- **topics help**

```bash
ros2 topics -h
```

- **Start turtlesim and keyboard control**

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

- **Node Relationship Diagram**

```bash
rqt_graph
```

- **Learn about topic-related commands**

```bash
ros2 topics -h
```

- **topics list**

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic list -t # Display the corresponding message type
```

- **View topic content**

```bash
ros2 topic echo <topic_name>
ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
```

- **Display topic-related information, type**

```bash
ros2 topic info <topic_name>
# Output /turtle1/cmd_vel topic related information
ros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
```

- **Display interface related information**

```bash
ros2 interface show <msg_type>
# Output geometry_msgs/msg/Twist interface related information
ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
```

- **Issue an order**

```bash
ros2 topic pub <topic_name> <msg_type> '<args>' 
# Issue speed command
ros2 topic pub --once /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}"
# Issue speed commands at a certain frequency
ros2 topic pub --rate 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}"
```

- **See how often topics are posted**

```bash
ros2 topic hz <topic_name>
# Output /turtle1/cmd_vel publish frequency
ros2 topic pub --rate 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}"
```

## 2.2 Nodes

Each node in ROS should be responsible for a single, module purpose (e.g. one node for controlling wheel motors, one node for controlling a laser range-finder, etc). Each node can send and receive data to other nodes via topics, services, actions, or parameters.
A full robotic system is comprised of many nodes working in concert. In ROS 2, a single executable (C++ program, Python program, etc.) can contain one or more nodes.

ros2 node info /my_turtle
```

## 2.3 Services

Services are another method of communication for nodes in the ROS graph. Services are based on a call-and-response model, versus topics’ publisher-subscriber model. While topics allow nodes to subscribe to data streams and get continual updates, services only provide data when they are specifically called by a client.

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Services/Understanding-ROS2-Services.html)

- **services help**

ros2 service call /clear std_srvs/srv/Empty
```

- **Spawn a new turtle**

```bash
ros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn "{x: 2, y: 2, theta: 0.2, name: 'turtle2'}"
```

## 2.4 Parameters

A parameter is a configuration value of a node. You can think of parameters as node settings. A node can store parameters as integers, floats, booleans, strings, and lists. In ROS 2, each node maintains its own parameters. For more background on parameters, please see the concept document.

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Parameters/Understanding-ROS2-Parameters.html)

- **parameters help**

```bash
ros2 param set <node_name> <parameter_name> <value>
ros2 param set /turtlesim background_r 150
```

- **Export parameter values**

```bash
ros2 param dump <node_name>
ros2 param dump /turtlesim
```

- **Import parameters independently**

```bash
ros2 param load <node_name> <parameter_file>
ros2 param load /turtlesim ./turtlesim.yaml
```

- **Start the node and import parameters at the same time**

```bash
ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name> --ros-args --params-file <file_name>
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args --params-file ./turtlesim.yaml
```

## 2.5 Actions

Actions are one of the communication types in ROS 2 and are intended for long running tasks. They consist of three parts: a goal, feedback, and a result.

Actions are built on topics and services. Their functionality is similar to services, except actions are preemptable (you can cancel them while executing). They also provide steady feedback, as opposed to services which return a single response.

Actions use a client-server model, similar to the publisher-subscriber model (described in the topics tutorial). An “action client” node sends a goal to an “action server” node that acknowledges the goal and returns a stream of feedback and a result.

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Actions/Understanding-ROS2-Actions.html)


- **action help**

```bash
ros2 action -h

# With feedback information
ros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute "{theta: 0}" --feedback
```

## 2.6 RQt

RQt is a graphical user interface framework that implements various tools and interfaces in the form of plugins. One can run all the existing GUI tools as dockable windows within RQt! The tools can still run in a traditional standalone method, but RQt makes it easier to manage all the various windows in a single screen layout.

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-RQt.html)

You can run any RQt tools/plugins easily by:

```bash
rqt
```

- **rqt help**
  
```bash
rqt -h
```

- **Start turtlesim and keyboard control**

```bash

```

## 2.7 TF2

tf2 is the transform library, which lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. tf2 maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered in time and lets the user transform points, vectors, etc. between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time.

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Intermediate/Tf2/Introduction-To-Tf2.html)

Let’s start by installing the demo package and its dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-turtle-tf2-py ros-foxy-tf2-tools ros-foxy-tf-transformations
```

## 2.9 Launch

The launch system in ROS 2 is responsible for helping the user describe the configuration of their system and then execute it as described. The configuration of the system includes what programs to run, where to run them, what arguments to pass them, and ROS-specific conventions which make it easy to reuse components throughout the system by giving them each a different configuration. It is also responsible for monitoring the state of the processes launched, and reporting and/or reacting to changes in the state of those processes.

Launch files written in Python, XML, or YAML can start and stop different nodes as well as trigger and act on various events. 

Specific reference: [Official Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Creating-Launch-Files.html)


**Setup**

Create a new directory to store your launch files:

```bash
mkdir launch
```

**Writer the launch file**

Let’s put together a ROS 2 launch file using the turtlesim package and its executables. As mentioned above.

Copy and paste the complete code into the launch/turtlesim_mimic_launch.py file:

```bash
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim1',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim2',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            executable='mimic',
            name='mimic',
            remappings=[
                ('/input/pose', '/turtlesim1/turtle1/pose'),
                ('/output/cmd_vel', '/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel'),
            ]
        )
    ])
```

**Run the ros2 launch file**

To run the launch file created above, enter into the directory you created earlier and run the following command:

The syntax format is:

```bash
ros2 launch <package_name> <launch_file_name>
```

```bash
cd launch
ros2 launch turtlesim_mimic_launch.py
```

- **launch help**

```bash
ros2 launch -h
```

- **running node**

```bash

ros2 launch turtlebot3_fake_node turtlebot3_fake_node.launch.py --show-arguments
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.launch.py -s
```

- **Run the launch file with parameters**

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.launch.py usb_port:=/dev/opencr
```

- **Run the node and debug**

## 2.11 Package

A package can be considered a container for your ROS 2 code. If you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, then you’ll need it organized in a package. With packages, you can release your ROS 2 work and allow others to build and use it easily.

Package creation in ROS 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool. You can create a package using either CMake or Python, which are officially supported, though other build types do exist.

**Creating a workspace**

Create a new directory for every new workspace. The name doesn’t matter, but it is helpful to have it indicate the purpose of the workspace. Let’s choose the directory name ros2_ws, for “development workspace”:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
```

- **pkg help**

```bash
ros2 pkg -h
```

- **List Feature Packs**

```bash
ros2 pkg executable turtlesim
```

- **Output a function package executable program**

```bash
ros2 pkg executable turtlesim
```

- **Create a Python package**

Make sure you are in the src folder before running the package creation command.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
```

The command syntax for creating a new package in ROS 2 is:

```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python <package_name>
# you will use the optional argument --node-name which creates a simple Hello World type executable in the package.
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --node-name my_node my_package
```

- **Build a package**

Putting packages in a workspace is especially valuable because you can build many packages at once by running colcon build in the workspace root. Otherwise, you would have to build each package individually.

```bash
# Return to the root of your workspace:
cd ~/ros2_ws
# Now you can build your packages:
colcon build
```

- **Source the setup file**

To use your new package and executable, first open a new terminal and source your main ROS 2 installation.

Then, from inside the ros2_ws directory, run the following command to source your workspace:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Now that your workspace has been added to your path, you will be able to use your new package’s executables.

- **Use the package**

To run the executable you created using the --node-name argument during package creation, enter the command:

```bash
ros2 run my_package my_node
```
