# Raspberry Pi system environment:

The Raspberry Pi version comes with Ubuntu (V-20.04) system and built-in **ROS2 Galactic** development environment. There is no need to build and manage it. You only need to update the `mycobot_ros2` package.

`mycobot_ros2` is a ROS2 package launched by Elephant Robot for its mycobot series desktop six-axis robotic arm.

ROS2 project address: [http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2](http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2)

## 1 Update mycobot_ros2 package

In order to ensure that users can use the latest official packages in a timely manner, you can enter the `/home/er/colcon_ws/src` folder through the file manager, click the `ROS2 Shell` icon on the desktop or the corresponding icon in the lower bar of the desktop to open the ROS2 environment terminal:

Then run the command update:

```bash
# Clone the code on github
cd ~/colcon_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2.git # Please check the attention section below before deciding whether to execute this command
cd ..      # Back to work area
colcon build --symlink-install # Build the code in the workspace, --symlink-install: Avoid having to recompile python scripts every time you adjust them
source install/setup.bash # add environment variables
```

**Note:** If the `mycobot_ros2` folder already exists in the `/home/er/colcon_ws/src (equivalent to ~/colcon_ws/src)` directory, you need to delete the original `mycobot_ros2` before executing the above command. Among them, `er` in the directory path is the user name of the system.

So far, the ROS2 environment construction has been completed.You can learn [the basics of ROS2](11.2.2.2-ROS2基础.md) or [ROS2 use cases](11.2.2.4-基础功能.md)
