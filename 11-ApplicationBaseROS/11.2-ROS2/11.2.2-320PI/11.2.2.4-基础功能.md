## Control of the robotic arm

### 1 Slider Control

Click the `ROS2 Shell` icon on the desktop or the corresponding icon in the lower column of the desktop to open the ROS2 environment terminal:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-10.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-11.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-12.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

Then run the command:

```bash
# The default serial port name of mycobot 320-PI version is "/dev/ttyAMA0", and the baud rate is 115200.
ros2 launch mycobot_320pi slider_control.launch.py
```

It will **open rviz and a slider component** and you will see something like this:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-4.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

Then you can **control the movement of the model in rviz2 by dragging the slider** . The real mycobot will move with it.

**Please note: Since the robot arm will move to the current position of the model when the command is input, please make sure that the model in rviz2 does not appear to be worn out before you use the command** **Do not quickly drag the slider after connecting the robotic arm to prevent damage to the robotic arm**

### 2 Model Follow

In addition to the above controls, we can also **make the model follow the movement of the real robotic arm** .

Click the `ROS2 Shell` icon on the desktop or the corresponding icon in the lower column of the desktop to open the ROS2 environment terminal:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-10.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-11.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-12.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

Then run the command:

```bash
# The default serial port name of mycobot 320-PI version is "/dev/ttyAMA0", and the baud rate is 115200.
ros2 launch mycobot_320pi mycobot_follow.launch.py 
```

It will **open rviz to show the model following effect** .

### 3 GUI Control

On the basis of the previous, this package also **provides a simple GUI control interface** . This method means that the real robotic arms are linked with each other, please connect to mycobot.

Click the `ROS2 Shell` icon on the desktop or the corresponding icon in the lower column of the desktop to open the ROS2 environment terminal:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-10.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-11.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-12.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

Then run the command:

```bash
# The default serial port name of mycobot 320-PI version is "/dev/ttyAMA0", and the baud rate is 115200.
ros2 launch mycobot_320pi simple_gui.launch.py
```

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-5.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

### 4 Keyboard Control

**The function of keyboard control is added** in the package of `mycobot_320pi `, and it is synchronized in real time in rviz. This function relies on pythonApi, so make sure to connect with the real robotic arm.

Click the `ROS2 Shell` icon on the desktop or the corresponding icon in the lower column of the desktop to open the ROS2 environment terminal:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-10.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-11.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-12.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

Then run the command:
  
```bash
# The default serial port name of mycobot 320-PI version is "/dev/ttyAMA0", and the baud rate is 115200.
ros2 launch mycobot_320pi teleop_keyboard.launch.py 
```

The operation effect is as follows:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-6.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

The command line will output mycobot information, as follows:

```bash

```

Next, open another ROS2 environment terminal:

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-10.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-11.jpg
width ="500"  align = "center">

<img src =../../../resources/11-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2.7-12.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

Then run the command:

```bash
ros2 run mycobot_320pi teleop_keyboard
```

You will see the following output on the command line:

```bash
Mycobot Teleop Keyboard Controller
---------------------------
Movimg options(control coordinations [x,y,z,rx,ry,rz]):
              w(x+)

    a(y-)     s(x-)     d(y+)

    z(z-) x(z+)

u(rx+)   i(ry+)   o(rz+)
j(rx-)   k(ry-)   l(rz-)

Gripper control:
    g - open
    h - close

Other:
    1 - Go to init pose
    2 - Go to home pose
    3 - Resave home pose
    q - Quit

currently:	speed: 30	change percent: 2  
```

In this terminal, you can control the state of the robot arm and move the robot arm through the keys in the command line.
