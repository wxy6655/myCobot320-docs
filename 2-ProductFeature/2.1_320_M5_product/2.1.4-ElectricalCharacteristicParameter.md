#### 1.1 Type C ：Type C interface is used to connect and communicate with the PC, available for developers.

#### 1.2 Screen ：Screen is used to display the communication status of myCobot and calibrate the robot move to starting point with a 2-inch IPS screen.

#### 1.3 Button A, Button B and Button C is used to work with the screen in a coordinated way.

#### 1.4 Power switch ：Power switch is used to control the main power input. If it is switched off, the controller is also powered off.

#### 1.5 24V output ：Internal DC24V, available for users.

#### 1.6 Digital input/output: includes 6 digital input signals and 6 digital output signals for interaction with other devices, and together with other devices constitute an important part of the automation system.

Built-in I/O power supply, voltage 24V, single output maximum 0.2A. External power supply is not supported.

It should be noted that the output signal is in PNP form, and the input signal is in NPN form. The following is the external wiring diagram:

#### 1.7 Power DC input interface : It uses KPPX-4P R7BFDC power socket. The 24V 9.2A DC power adapter provided by the manufacturer can also be used to power myCobot320.

#### 1.8 Emergency stop circuit terminal is connected to the emergency stop button box, which can be used to control the emergency stop of the robot.

>  **Notice**: The emergency stop switch must be connected when the robot is in use, and make sure that the emergency stop switch circuit is always connected.

#### 2.1 End-tool IO interface: This is a tool I/O diagram, and the myCobot 320 robot provides one input and two outputs.

<img src="../../resources/8-FilesDownload/2-serialproduct/IO.png " width="800" height="auto" />

Built-in I/O power supply, voltage 24V, single output maximum 0.2A. External power supply is not supported.

The definition of each tool I/O port is shown in the following table. It should be noted that both the input and output of the tool I/O are PNP types, and the wiring mode is the same as the bottom output interface.
