## Use for Objects

**Introduction**

- Suction cup suction pump is that the suction port is connected with the object to be adsorbed through suction cups, tubes and other components, and vacuumizes the suction cup, causing the internal air pressure to change from normal pressure to negative pressure. The pressure difference between the external atmospheric pressure and this negative pressure is used to achieve adsorption. The purpose of living objects.

- The overall structure is a multi-functional expandable suction cup, which can be installed up to 4; high-pressure resistant hose, which can be reused many times; an air compressor with suction and blowing integrated, which can be expanded to other functions.

**working principle**

- Start the suction of the vacuum equipment to generate negative air pressure in the suction cup, so that the object to be lifted can be sucked firmly, and the object to be lifted can be started to be transported.

- When the object to be lifted is transported to the destination, inflate it smoothly into the vacuum suction cup, so that the negative air pressure in the vacuum suction cup becomes zero or slightly positive air pressure, and the vacuum suction cup is separated from the object to be lifted, thus completing the lifting and conveying of heavy objects task.

**Applicable objects :** suitable for objects with flat surfaces

 ## How to use

<img src="../../../resources/1-ProductIntroduction/1.4/1.4.2-PumpCup/ModuleSuctionCup-2.jpg" alt="img-1" width="800" height=“auto” />

For a system incorporating a suction cup, solenoid valve, and vacuum pump, the connection typically works as follows:

1. **Vacuum Pump**: This is the source of vacuum pressure. It should be connected to the solenoid valve's inlet port.
2. **Solenoid Valve**: Acts as a control mechanism that regulates when and how the vacuum is applied or released to the suction cup. The vacuum pump connects to one side of the solenoid valve, and the suction cup connects to the outlet side.
3. **Suction Cup**: This is the end-effector that directly interacts with the objects to be manipulated. It connects to the outlet side of the solenoid valve.

In operation, when the solenoid valve is energized, it opens, allowing vacuum pressure from the pump to reach the suction cup, enabling it to grip objects. De-energizing the valve cuts off the vacuum, allowing air to flow back to the suction cup, releasing the grip on the object. This setup is efficient for automation systems requiring precise control over picking and placing items.
