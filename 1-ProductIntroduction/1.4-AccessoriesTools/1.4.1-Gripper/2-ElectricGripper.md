## Use for Gripping Objects

**Introduction**

- PGE series are industrial thin parallel electric grippers, and the numbers represent the maximum clamping force of the grippers. The gripper is equipped with a pair of parallel fingertips, which run symmetrically during the movement. The main structure of the gripper is a smooth rectangular structure, which is small in size and saves installation space. It has 5 mounting holes to meet different installation conditions of the equipment.

- Quick response, high grabbing frequency, and equipped with an 8-core communication interface, mainly to achieve clamping or stuck objects, suitable for relatively light objects.

**working principle**

- The motor drives the rack and pinion and the cross roller guide to realize the opening or closing action of the gripper. The positioning point of the electric gripper is controllable and the clamping is controllable.

**Applicable object**

- The volume is smaller than the clamping stroke

- The weight is less than the maximum clamping weight

- Custom fingertips can expand more items
