# C++
**Using C++ language, you can make developments (coordinate control, angle control, io control, gripper control, etc.) freely through the C++ dynamic library developed by our company, and control some of the robots which have been developed by us.** <br>

# What is C++?<br>
C++ is the inheritance of C language. It may be used to carry out procedural programming of C language, object-based programming characterized by abstract data types, and object-oriented programming characterized by inheritance and polymorphism.<br>
While C++ is good at object-oriented programming, it also can be used to carry out process-based programming, so C++ can adapt to the size of the problem.<br>
C++ not only has the practical characteristics of efficient computer operation, but also strives to improve the programming quality of large-scale programs and the problem description ability of programming languages.<br>

**Applicable equipment:**
  
- myCobot 320
  - myCobot 320 M5 <br>


**Preconditions for use：**

- **M5** series version， the bottom **M5Stack-basic** is programmed to miniRobot , select the  **Transponder** function, and the end **ATOM** is programmed to the latest version of atomMain (the factory default has been programmed)
