Robot drag teaching is a process during which the operator can drag the joints of the robot directly to make them do ideal postures, and then make records corresponding thereto.

The cobot is a system that has this function earlier. This kind of teaching avoids various disadvantages of traditional teaching, so it is a prospective technology for robot applications.

**Different types of equipment have different operating methods**. They have the approximate steps below: 
- Burn the latest version of **atomMain** for **Atom**, and the **minirobot** for **M5Stack-basic**. Choose the **Maincontrol** function (It is unnecessary to burn **M5Stack-basic** for
micro-CPU devices). 
- Press the recording button/keyboard key
-  select a storage path (micro-CPU devices haven't this step)
-  directly drag the joints of the robot arm to move them to your desired positions to complete a set of movements
-  press the designated button/keyboard key for saving
-  press the play button/keyboard key/keyboard key
-  select a corresponding storage path, and then the robot arm starts to move
-  and finally press the exit button/keyboard key to exit this function

In this chapter, we will teach you how to get started easily and experience the fun of cobot drag teaching.

- myCobot 320 M5

### 2 Steps to Operate the Arms

**Step1:** Burn the latest **atomMain** for **Atom.**

**Step 2:** Burn**minirobot**for**M5Stack-basic**, and press **Maincontrol**.

>
> **Pause**: pause the movement
>
> **Stop**: stop the movement
>
> **Play**: resume the movement
